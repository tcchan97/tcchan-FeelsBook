## Purpose of App:
The application is used to record the emotions of a individual. it give the access of recording an emotion while writing a message, when an emotion is clicked. When this occurs the emotion is then record with the date. After the emotion is displayed in a list in which the user can scroll through to access their record emotions. If the user wants to change their message and date of when the emotion if recorded. The user can then click on the emotion to edit the message or date and time. If the user chooses to remove the record of the emotion then the user can click and hold on the emotion to remove the emotion recording.

### How the code works
When a user clicked on one of the 6 emotions on the screen, an emotion object is created and stored in an emotion array meanwhile the count for the emotion is incremented. I created and Emotion array class that stores emotion objects in a array and then I added methods which can update the count for each emotion and return the values for each emotion count.
